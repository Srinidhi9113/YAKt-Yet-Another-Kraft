## YAKt (Yet Another Kraft)

## Overview

YAKt is an educational and exploratory project, aiming to create a detailed imitation of the mechanisms underlying Zookeeper and Kraft. This project is designed for those intrigued by the inner workings of distributed systems and consensus algorithms. It's an attempt to demystify and replicate the functionalities of these systems, not as a direct replacement, but as a learning tool and a tribute to their complex architectures.

## Objectives

The primary goals of YAKt include:

- Gaining a deep understanding of the Raft Consensus algorithm, focusing on Leader Election, Log Replication, and Fault Tolerance.
- Exploring the ZAB (Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast) Consensus algorithm.
- Delving into the architectural nuances of Kraft and Zookeeper.
- Implementing an Event-Driven Architecture.
- Studying and replicating key aspects of Kafka's architecture.

## Features

- **HTTP API Interface:** YAKt offers a user-friendly HTTP API, allowing for easy interaction and integration.
- **Raft  Implementation:** Core focus on the Raft  consensus algorithm to ensure reliable and efficient distributed coordination.
- **Fault-Tolerant Design:** Emphasis on creating a fault-tolerant system capable of handling various network and node failures.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilizes an event-driven approach to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
- **Detailed Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging for understanding system behavior and for debugging purposes.
